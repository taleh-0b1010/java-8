     * --------------------------------------HashSet----------------------------------------
     * A HashSet stores its elements in a hash table. This means that it uses the hashCode()
     * method of the objects to retrieve them more efficiently.
     *
     * The main benefit is that adding elements and checking if an element is in the set both
     * have constant time. The tradeoff is that you lose the order in which you inserted the
     * elements. Most of the time, you arenâ€™t concerned with this in a set anyway, making HashSet
     * the most common set.
     *
     * --------------------------------------TreeSet----------------------------------------
     * A TreeSet stores its elements in a sorted tree structure. The main benefit is that the set
     * is always in sorted order. The tradeoff is that adding and checking if an element is pres-
     * ent are both O(log n).
