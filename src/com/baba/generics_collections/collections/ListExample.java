     * --------------------------------------ArrayList----------------------------------------
     *
     * The main benefit of an ArrayList is that you can look up any element in constant time.
     * Adding or removing an element is slower than accessing an element. This makes an
     * ArrayList a good choice when you are reading more often than (or the same amount as)
     * writing to the ArrayList.
     *
     * -------------------------------------LinkedList----------------------------------------
     *
     * A LinkedList is special because it implements both List and Queue . It has all of the
     * methods of a List . It also has additional methods to facilitate adding or removing from the
     * beginning and/or end of the list.
     *
     * The main benefits of a LinkedList are that you can access, add, and remove from the
     * beginning and end of the list in constant time. The tradeoff is that dealing with an arbitrary
     * index takes linear time. This makes a LinkedList a good choice when youâ€™ll be using it as Queue .
