     * --------------------------------------HashMap---------------------------------------------
     *
     *A HashMap stores the keys in a hash table. This means that it uses the hashCode() method
     * of the keys to retrieve their values more efficiently.
     * The main benefit is that adding elements and retrieving the element by key both have
     * constant time. The tradeoff is that you lose the order in which you inserted the elements.
     * Most of the time, you arenâ€™t concerned with this in a map anyway. If you were, you could
     * use LinkedHashMap .
     *
     * --------------------------------------TreeMap---------------------------------------------
     * A TreeMap stores the keys in a sorted tree structure. The main benefit is that the keys are
     * always in sorted order. The tradeoff is that adding and checking if a key is present are both
     * O(log n).
